                    <p><em>Dream</em> wedding. Who doesn't want to hear that? Who doesn't want to have that?</p>
                    <p>We are proud to say we helped Mihai & Mirela make their dream come true.
                        They had an amazing time in our favourite <b>location</b> - MPalace - in Bucharest, with their
                        family and friends.

                    <h3>"Our team is stronger than ever!"</h3>
                    <p>This is what we heard on a sunnny Monday morning. Rick, the manager of Emag, just got back with
                        feedback about the teambuilding we organized for his team this weekend.</p>
                    <p> Not only we were very pleased to hear it, but Emag has been working with TODO events for a very
                        long
                        time, so keeping our customer <em>happy</em> and <em>loyal</em> is one of our top priorities</p>
                    <p> The team, consisting of 20 people, had a nice 4 days trip to Poiana Brasov, a mountain location
                        in
                        Romania. They stayed at Mariotte and had all meals included, and an extra special dinner</p>
                    <p> We organized different activities, including personalized trainings but also fun ones such as:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Ski and snowboard</li>
                        <li>Swimming and jacuzzi</li>
                        <li>Pasta cooking class</li>
                        <li>Board games night</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Overall, everybody was very pleased, or as we say in Romania: <i lang="ro">Chef pe cinste</i>.
                        See
                        you soon Rick!</p>
